Here’s the translation of the task into English:

# Task

There are 3 functions:

1) `getUsers()` - asynchronous function, the final output is an array of user objects. Example of a user object:
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  gender: number, (0 - female, 1 - male),
  ... the rest of the data is irrelevant for the context of the task
}
```

2) `getPreferences(userID)` - asynchronous function, the final output is an array of the user's preferred products (from 0 to 5 items), with no duplicate values in the array. 
Example:
```javascript
[id, id, id, ...] 
```
If there are 0 items, the result is `[]`, and `id` is alphanumeric.

3) `getGenderPreferences(gender)` - asynchronous function, the final output is an array of preferred products based on the user's gender (from 2 to 5 items), with no duplicate values in the array. 
Example:
```javascript
[id, id, id, ...] 
```
If there are 0 items, the result is `[]`, and `id` is alphanumeric.

(*) - The `getUsers`, `getPreferences`, and `getGenderPreferences` functions are basic, and you can assume they are already developed. For convenience, you can make them return static data with a delay. The implementation of these functions is not crucial for this test.

## Task:

Write an asynchronous function whose final output is an array of the top 10 products based on the following logic:

1) The top products are determined by the most frequent occurrences of items in users' preference lists.

2) Exactly 5 products from each user's preference list should be considered.

3) If a user has fewer than 5 products in their preference list, their list should be supplemented with products from the top products list based on their gender. The final preference list for the user must not contain duplicates.

4) If after step 3, the user’s preference list still contains fewer than 5 items, that user is excluded from the final selection.
